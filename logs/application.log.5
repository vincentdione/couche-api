2024-11-03 23:19:25 WARN  [io.quarkus.hibernate.orm.runtime.FastBootHibernatePersistenceProvider] (JPA Startup Thread) Persistence-unit [<default>] sets unsupported properties. These properties may not work correctly, and even if they do, that may change when upgrading to a newer version of Quarkus (even just a micro/patch version). Consider using a supported configuration property before falling back to unsupported ones. If there is no supported equivalent, make sure to file a feature request so that a supported configuration property can be added to Quarkus, and more importantly so that the configuration property is tested regularly. Unsupported properties being set: [hibernate.physical_naming_strategy]
